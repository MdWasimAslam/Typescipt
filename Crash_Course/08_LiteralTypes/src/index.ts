//Literal Types - A literal type is a type that represents a single value, rather than a range of values. This is most commonly used when you want to allow a variable to only have a specific value.

type Qunatity =50 | 100; // This is a literal type as it can only have 50 or 100 as value


const Quantity:Qunatity = 100;
